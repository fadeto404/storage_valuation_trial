# storage_valuation_trial

A few trials with the cmdty-storage project. The file `tutorial.py` follows the instruction notebooks closely whereas `german_gas_storage.py` is a trial using a small arbitrarily chosen set of German gas storage facilities in an attempt to do hourly valuation for each of the facilities.

Result: Trial was unsuccesful due to issues with the Least-Squares Monte Carlo process (Cholesky decomposition failing due lacking positive definiteness of matrix).
